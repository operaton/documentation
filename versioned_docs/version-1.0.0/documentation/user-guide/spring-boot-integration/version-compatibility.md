Operaton and its compatible Spring Boot Starter always share the same version. Each version of the Operaton Spring Boot Starter is bound to a specific version of Spring Boot. Only these default combinations are recommended (and supported) by Operaton. Other combinations must be thoroughly tested before being used in production.
