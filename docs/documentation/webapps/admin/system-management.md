The System Settings menu gives you general information about the process engine. It enables users with system permissions to access certain system information, including diagnostics and metrics.

:::note[Accessing the System Settings menu]
The System Settings menu is only usable by users which are granted with *All* permission for authorizations.

## Diagnostics

![Example img](./img/admin-diagnostics.png)Diagnostics

The **Diagnostics** menu allows you to view and copy diagnostics data about your environment or distribution of Operaton. The main purpose of the **Diagnostics** menu is to increase transparency by giving you easy access to important system diagnostics information. In the event of an issue, this should also improve problem diagnosis by enabling you to quickly understand and share the Operaton environment you are running.

## Execution Metrics

![Example img](./img/admin-execution-metrics.png)Execution Metrics

The Execution Metrics menu in Admin displays an approximate number of *Flow Nodes Instances (FNI)*,
*Executed Decision Elements (EDE)*, *Process Instances (PI)* and *Decision
Instances (DI)* processed by the engine and *Task Users (TU)* that were assigned to a
user task by the selected contract start date.

The page displays the rolling last 12 months metrics in a chart and table.
Legacy metrics (FNI, EDE) are hidden by default, but can be displayed by selecting the **Display legacy metrics** checkbox.
Underneath, it displays all the available annual usage metrics.
