The BPMN model API enables easy extraction of information from an existing process definition, editing an existing process definition or creating a complete new one without manual XML parsing.

Note: Currently the BPMN model API does not support the entire BPMN 2.0 specification. The list of already supported BPMN 2.0 elements can be found in the source code package `org.camunda.bpm.model.bpmn.instance`.
