# Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL)

Decision Model and Notation (DMN) defines a Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL). It can be used to evaluate expressions in a decision table.

Operaton relies on an independently maintained project to provide FEEL support. You can find the documentation about the FEEL Language Reference in the [FEEL Scala Engine Documentation](https://camunda.github.io/feel-scala/) (link to external documentation).

Please also check out the [User Guide](../../../user-guide/dmn-engine/feel/index.md) to learn more about the integration of the FEEL Scala Engine in Operaton.
