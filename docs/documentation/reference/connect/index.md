Operaton Connect provides a simple API for connecting HTTP services and other
things. It aims at two usage scenarios: usage in a generic system such as the
Operaton process engine and standalone usage via API.

## Connectors

Operaton Connect provides a HTTP and a SOAP HTTP connector. If you want to
add an own connector to Connect please have a look at the [extending Connect](/docs/documentation/reference/connect/extending-connect.md)
section. This section also describes the usage of a `ConnectorConfigurator` to
configure the connector instances.

During the request invocation of a connector an interceptor chain is passed.
The user can add own interceptors to this chain. The interceptor is called for
every request of this connector.

```java
connector.addRequestInterceptor(interceptor).createRequest();
```

## Maven Coordinates

Connect can be used in any Java-based application by adding the following maven
dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

Operaton Connect is published to [maven central](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=org.operaton+connect).

:::info[Process engine plugin]
If you are using Connect in the Operaton process engine, you also need the `operaton-engine-plugin-connect` dependency. For more information, refer to the [Connectors guide](/docs/documentation/user-guide/process-engine/connectors.md).

# Logging

Operaton Connect uses [operaton-commons-logging](https://github.com/operaton/operaton-bpm-platform/tree/master/commons/logging) which itself uses [SLF4J](http://slf4j.org) as a logging backend. To enable logging a SLF4J implementation has to be part of
your classpath. For example `slf4j-simple`, `log4j12` or `logback-classic`.

Apache HTTP Client 5.x has built-in SLF4J support, so no additional bridges are required for HTTP client logging.
