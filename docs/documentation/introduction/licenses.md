# GPL Cooperation Commitment

## Our Commitment

Before filing or continuing to prosecute any legal proceeding or claim (other than a Defensive Action) arising from termination of a Covered License, Operaton commits to extend to the person or entity (“you”) accused of violating the Covered License the following provisions regarding cure and reinstatement, taken from GPL version 3. As used here, the term ‘this License’ refers to the specific Covered License being enforced.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Operaton intends this Commitment to be irrevocable, and binding and enforceable against Operaton and assignees of or successors to Operaton’s copyrights.

Operaton may modify this Commitment by publishing a new edition on this page or a successor location.

## Definitions

‘Defensive Action’ means a legal proceeding or claim that Operaton brings against you in response to a prior proceeding or claim initiated by you or your affiliate.
