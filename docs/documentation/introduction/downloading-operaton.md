# Prerequisites

Before downloading Operaton, make sure you have a JRE (Java Runtime Environment), or better, a JDK
(Java Development Kit) installed. Please check the supported [Java versions](./supported-environments.md#java).

[Download JDK][get-jdk]


# Download the Runtime

Operaton is a flexible framework which can be used in different contexts. See [Architecture Overview](./architecture.md) for more details. Based on how you want
to use Operaton, you can choose a different distribution.


## Spring Boot and Docker

It is also possible to run Operaton with [Spring Boot][run-with-spring-boot] and [Docker][run-with-docker].


## Full Distribution

Download the full distribution if you want to use a [shared process engine][shared-engine] or if you
want to get to know Operaton quickly, without any additional setup or installation steps required.

The full distribution bundles

* Process Engine configured as [shared process engine][shared-engine],
* Runtime Web Applications (Tasklist, Cockpit, Admin),
* Rest Api,
* Container / Application Server itself.

:::note[Server/Container]
  If you download the full distribution for an open-source application
  server/container, the container itself is included. For example, if you download the Tomcat
  distribution, Tomcat itself is included and the Operaton binaries (process engine and
  web apps) are pre-installed in the container. This is not true for the the Oracle WebLogic
  and IBM WebSphere downloads; these downloads do not include the application servers themselves.
