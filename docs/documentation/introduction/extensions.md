Operaton is developed by Operaton as an open source project in collaboration with the community. This is the basis for the Operaton product provided by Operaton as a commercial offering.

# Extensions

Operaton supports the community in its effort to build additional community extensions under the Operaton umbrella. Such community extensions are maintained by the community and are not part of the commercial Operaton product.

The [Operaton Community Hub](https://github.com/operaton-community-hub) is a GitHub organization that serves as the home of Operaton open source, community-contributed extensions. You can migrate an extension you've built to the Hub, search for existing extensions, or get started with open source by helping community extension maintainers with open issue or pull request triage.

## Building a Extension

Do you have a great idea around open source BPM you want to share with the world? Awesome! Operaton will support you in building your own community extension. Have a look at our [process for creating a new community extension](https://github.com/operaton-community-hub/community/blob/main/creating-new-extensions.md) to find out how to propose a community project.

You can also visit the Operaton Community Hub [community repository](https://github.com/operaton-community-hub/community) to learn more about migrating your community extension into the community hub, benefits to joining the Operaton Community Hub organization, contributing to an extension, and much more.

The Operaton Community Hub enables developers to have a centralized home for their Operaton community extensions, and aids new contributors to open source software in discovering new projects to work on.
