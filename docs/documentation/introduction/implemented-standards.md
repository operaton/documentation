Operaton implements three different standards in the Business Process Management scope: BPMN 2.0, CMMN 1.1 and DMN 1.3.
These three standards are defined by the [Object Management Group][OMG] with active collaboration of Operaton.

Operaton provides open source implementations of execution and [modeling tools][modelers].

## BPMN

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard for Workflow and Process Automation.
Operaton supports the 2.0 version of BPMN.

## CMMN

Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) is a standard for Case Management.
Operaton supports the 1.1 version of CMMN.

## DMN

Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard for Business Decision Management.
Operaton supports the 1.1 version of DMN.
