# Operaton Security Guide

This page describes Operaton (also referred to as the 'software') from a security perspective. It has two parts:

* **Instructions for operating the software securely:** Provides an overview of how to secure a Operaton installation. In order to secure a Operaton installation, Operaton itself must be configured correctly and it must be integrated correctly into its environment. This section also identifies areas where we consider security issues to be relevant for the specific Operaton product and listed those in the subsequent sections. Compliance for those areas is ensured based on common industry best practices and influenced by security requirements of standards like OWASP Top 10 and others. 

* **Reporting a Vulnerability:** Explains how to report a security vulnerability to Operaton Community.
