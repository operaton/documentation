First, you need to install the Operaton Platform and the Camunda Modeler.

In the following section, we'll describe how to install the Operaton Platform locally on your machine.

:::note[Hint]
If you prefer, you can also run the Operaton Platform with Docker:

# Operaton Platform

First, download a distribution of the Operaton Platform. You can choose from different distributions for [various application servers](/docs/documentation/installation/full/). In this tutorial, we'll use Operaton Platform Run. Download it from [the download page](https://camunda.com/download/).

After downloading the distribution, unpack it inside a directory of your choice.

After you've successfully unpacked your distribution of the Operaton Platform, execute the script named `start.bat` (for Windows users) or `start.sh` (for Unix users).

This script will start the application server. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to visit the Welcome Page.

# Camunda Modeler

Download the Camunda Modeler from [the download page](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/).

After downloading the Modeler, simply unzip the download in a folder of your choice.

After you have successfully unpacked the zip, run `camunda-modeler.exe` (for Windows users), `camunda-modeler.app` (for Mac users), or `camunda-modeler.sh` (for Linux users).

:::note[Next Step]
Once you've installed the Operaton Platform and the Camunda Modeler, you can move to the next step to [model and execute your first process](/docs/get-started/quick-start/service-task/).
